# prepost

This package contains code and sample data to implement the non-parametric bounds and Bayesian methods for assessing post-treatment bias developed in _Priming bias versus post-treatment bias in experimental designs_, Blackwell et al. (Forthcoming).

Functions prefixed with `post_` should be used to analyze data from a **post-test design**: i.e., one where the moderator is measured post-treatment.

Functions prefixed with `prepost_` should be used to analyze data from a **random placement design**, in which the moderator is randomly assigned to be measured before or after treatment.
